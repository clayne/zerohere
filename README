This tool does only one thing: makes a new file wherever it's run, floods it
with zero bytes, and deletes it on the first write failure. The purpose of
this tool is to zero out all of the free space on a filesystem, specifically
to work around the absence of TRIM support, since zero-filling all free space
will tell almost any eMMC/SSD controller chip that the space is no longer in
use, or at least that it can all be compressed into a single memory page.

There is a very good chance that this program will never be updated...because
why bother? It's the simplest thing in the world. Regardless, if you happen to
find bugs or make improvements, I'll gladly accept them.
